This for contains the files for a cross platform web based GUI


Usage (before feeding back read about the known issues, especially the bit about pywin32 for Windows users):

OSX/Linux:	sudo ./setup.py
Windows:	python setup.py (or double-click the setup.py)

Requirements: 

1>	as per PlexConnect install guide on wiki
2>	Windows users also need to install the version of pywin32 that matches their version of Python (both in terms of version number and 32/64 bit type - this will also let users run Python as a service)

What is in place / working:

	•	GUI is automatically launched in user's browser, if the OS has no browser then the user will be provided with the URL from which they can access the GUI from another device on the local network
	•	First run setup wizard automatically generates certificates for the apps (Trailers/iMove Theatre/WSJ) and guides the user through configuring their ATV, including automatically figuring out what IP to use for the ATV's DNS server; this should simplify things for users and remove a lot of problems with certificate generation on, especially on Windows
	•	Automatic online certificate generation for Windows reeves the needs to find and install the right version of SSL
	•	If certificates have already been generated by a user for an app and named correctly (e.g. trailers.pem) then those ones will be skipped and the user ones used instead
	•	Option to automatically start PlexConnect at boot (OSX daemon / Windows service) - not sure if this is working on Linux variants or if they will have to be added individually per variant
	•	First run will use a default settings.cfg (this is something we wish to encourage and users can change the options after starting PlexConnect)
	•	First run and any subsequent saving of settings will force a restart of PlexConnect to ensure settings.cfg is saved
	•	Tooltips provide explanations of all configurable options
	•	Log can be shown/hidden in real time to see what is happening
	•	Page renders correctly on iPhone/iPad browser (please confirm about Android devices)




Known issues:

	1)	The GUI currently uses a separate web server to that of PlexConnect, this web server will continue to run in the background unless you shut it down through the GUI (there is a temporary "exit GUI" button in place for this reason). 
	2)	Moving to use PlexConnect's web server instead requires putting further logic in. Currently if ports 53 or 80 are already in use PlexConnect will automatically shutdown, instead it should serve up a local web page explaining the issue with the port(s) in use for the user and providing a link to the support forum)
	3)	There are currently no working clickable icon launchers for OSX and Windows (the ones in the folder do not currently work). Feel free to create a pull request for working ones on OSX (Applescript/Platypus/Cocoa is fine) or Windows (bat or exe).
	4)	Windows - if pywin32 is not installed then the GUI will exit. Possibly we change this so that the user is directed to install this dependancy (it is also needed for running as a service on Windows)
	5)	Tooltips on main page can be annoying on touch based device browsers and needs to be resolved (maybe different behaviour based upon browser user string as once setup on a PC the tooltips may not be needed / option to disable tooltips ?)
	6)	Need to add acknowledgement: "Windows SSL cert generation provided by selfsignedcertificate.com"
	7)	No update functionality included as this is not in the main code
	8)	Link to landing page / wiki should be included
	9)	No password protection, anyone on your LAN can access it - therefore don't open up ports in your router and let any man and his dog in!! (probably not to much of an issue at the moment as it only runs when specified - just make sure you shut it down afterwards) - other option is to limit access to LAN addresses only
	10)	Do we need a guided pywin32 install?
	11)	Did we remember to add in guidance when switching app about installing new profile on ATV?
